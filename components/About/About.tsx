                    <span className="font-black">Rarity Radar</span> primarily
                    uses a trait normalized rarity score to calculate the rank
                    of every individual NFT. There really is no perfect method
                    to calculate the rarity of an NFT, as this can sometimes be
                    subjective; however we feel we provide a thorough analysis
                    with detailed analytics in order to provide our users with
                    the highest chance of finding that <span>ðŸ’Ž</span> in the
